## Introduction

LuaRecipes is a development project to create a website for submission,
collaboration, review and searching of recipes for the [Lua][4] programming
language.  This project was prompted by a [post][1] from Steve Donovan on the
lua-l mailing list.  This codebase is an attempt to realize the discussed
project.

## Project Layout

The initial attempt at this project is based on [Sputnik][2], a wiki and
content platform written using Lua.  The project source is organized in the
following way:

  * README - This readme file
  * setup.sh - A unix setup script that downloads and install Lua/Luarocks/Sputnik/Kepler within a subdirectory.  This installation will not affect any other Lua installation on your system.
  * sputnik.git - This directory holds a submodule that contains the git master from the Sputnik [repository][3].
  * luarecipes - This directory contains the rock definition and code for a sputnik module, where all of the custom code for the application will be stored.

After running the setup script, will have a directory called `sandbox` inside
this directory as well.  It will contain your Lua installation, your
[Luarocks][5] installation, [Kepler][6] and any other supporting code.  This
file is ignored by git and should not contain anything other than the software
necessary to run an instance of LuaRecipes on your local machine.
